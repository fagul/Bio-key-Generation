% TERRACE - Terracing operator for potential field data.
%
% Useage: terrimg = terrace(img, nIter, sigma)
%
% Arguments:
%       img - Input image to be terraced
%     nIter - Number of iterations. This controls the degree of
%             terracing. Values from 1 to 20 are useful.  Small values can
%             be used to provide a simple sharpening effect.
%     sigma - Standard deviation of Laplacian of Gaussian used to compute the
%             2nd derivatives.  This controls the scale of analysis.  Large
%             values will result in small features being smoothed out.  Try
%             values from 1 to 5. Typically small values are better.
%
% Returns:
%   terrimg - Terraced image.
%
%
% This implementation differs from that suggested by Cordell and McCafferty
% and by Cooper and Cowan in two ways:
%
% 1) The curvature/second derivative information is fixed at the values computed
% from the original image.  It is not recomputed on each iteration as this is
% highly unstable and leads to anomalous 'ripples' in the output.  Such ripples
% can be seen in figures 4 and 5 of Cooper and Cowan's paper.  The key attribute
% of this code is that the output remains stable no matter how many iterations
% are applied.
%
% 2) Curvature is not computed, all that is required is the 2nd derivative.  If
% the 2nd derivative is +ve then curvature will be +ve and vice-versa.  The
% Laplacian of Gaussian used to compute 2nd derivatives, the standard deviation
% can be used to control the scale of analysis.
